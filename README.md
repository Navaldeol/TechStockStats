# TechStockStats
Finding statistics like Daily Return, Daily Close, and Percent Loss of Tech stocks like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.
Analysis was conducted using the Jupityer Notebook and Python modules including Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas. 
A few weeks after I completed this project, tech stocks in the US took a plunge. Through statistics I attempted to predict the safest stocks to potentially invest in, however the stock market can be extremly volatile and not even statistics can guarantee that you will make or lose money.
